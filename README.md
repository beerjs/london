# BeerJS London
*beer.js is about creating social spaces to strengthen software communities. There is no requirement to drink to participate.*

JavaScript and Beer, what else do we need?
A meetup for general discussions about technologies over a couple of pints. Bonus pints if you can share your f__k ups (and how to avoid them).
