# BeerJS London
====
*beer.js is about creating social spaces to strengthen software communities. There is no requirement to drink to participate.*

We use github (this website!) to discuss things. If you're not used to that, here's a [quick video intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlrJVSJRUN4).


Leet's meet the others JavaScripters developer based in London (or if you are only for a few days you are also welcome to have a beer). 
In this repository we will discuss about date and locals have a beer and talk about nerd things.
